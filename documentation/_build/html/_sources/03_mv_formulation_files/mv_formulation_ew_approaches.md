# Equally weighted approaches


1. Equally weighted (EW) or 1/N portfolios.
2. Equally weighted risk contributions (EWRC).
3. Maximum diversification (MD).


## 1. Equally weighted (EW) or 1/N portfolios.

Optimal portfolios tend to be excessively concentrated in a limited subset of the full set of assets.

Optimal mean‚Äìvariance (MV) portfolios generally tend to be excessively concentrated in a limited subset of the full set of assets (portfolio concentration). A simple and naive way to solve this problem is to attribute the same weight to all the assets included in the portfolio. Equally weighted (EW) or $1/N$ portfolios are widely used in the literature.

The main advantages of the 1‚àïùëÅ naive approach are that it does not need to estimate the moments of asset returns or optimize a particular objective function with constraints.

The main drawback of the $1‚àïùëÅ$ rule is that it leads to very limited diversification of risks if individual risks are significantly different.


## 2. Equally weighted risk contributions (EWRC).

Risk parity is an approach that overcomes the previously mentioned limitation of the 1‚àïùëÅ rule by focusing on the allocation of risk rather than on the allocation of capital. The best-known version of risk parity is the equally weighted risk contributions (EWRC) portfolio method. This method quantifies the (total) risk contribution of the ùëõth asset, taking into account the partial derivative of the risk function with respect to the weight of the $n^{th}$ asset:

$$
w_n \times \partial_{w_n}
(\sum_{n,m=1} ^{N} w_n w_m \sigma_{nm})
=
w_n \times \frac{w_n \sigma_n ^2 + \sum_{n \neq m}} {\sum_{n,m=1} ^{N} w_n w_m \sigma_{nm}}
\varpropto w_n \times (\sum w)_n
$$


where $\sum$  $\epsilon$ $\Re^{N \times N}$ is the covariance matrix, $w = (w_1,...,w_N)$ $\epsilon$ $\Re^{N}$ the vector of weights and $(\sum_w)_n$ the $n^{th}$ row of the vector of the matrix obtained from the product of $\sum$ with $w$. Equal risk contribution then
means that $w_n \times (\sum_w)_n = w_m \times (\sum_w)_m$ for all $n,m$.

## 3. Maximum Diversification (MD).

It should be noted that the EWRC strategy is inspired by the maximum diversification (MD) technique, which maximizes the following diversification ratio.

$$
max_{w_1,...w_N}
\frac {\sum_{n=1}^N w_n \sigma_{nn}} {\sum_{n,m=1}^N w_n w_m \sigma n_m}
$$

$$
s.t.

\sum_{n=1}^N w_n = 1
$$

$$
w_1, ..., w_N \geq 0
$$
