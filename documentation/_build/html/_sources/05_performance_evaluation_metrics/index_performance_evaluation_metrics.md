# Performance evaluation metrics

Pipoh includes six performance measures that were computed for each technique. First three performance measures considered as input the time series of out-of-sample returns. The fourth was computed using the matrix of portfolio weights. Last two considers...

### Mean return (MR)
Mean returns attempt to quantify the relationship between the risk of a portfolio of securities and its return. It assumes that while investors have different risk tolerances, rational investors will always seek the maximum rate of return (RoR) for every level of acceptable risk.

$$
max_{w_1,...w_N}
\frac {\sum_{n=1}^N w_n \sigma_{nn}} {\sum_{n,m=1}^N w_n w_m \sigma n_m}
$$

### Sharpe ratio (SR)
Named after American economist, William Sharpe, the Sharpe Ratio (or Sharpe Index or Modified Sharpe Ratio) is commonly used to gauge the performance of an investment by adjusting for its risk.

The higher the ratio, the greater the investment return relative to the amount of risk taken, and thus, the better the investment. The ratio can be used to evaluate a single stock or investment, or an entire portfolio.

$$Sharpe Ratio = (Rx â€“ Rf) / StdDev Rx$$

Where:

$Rx$ = Expected portfolio return

$Rf$ = Risk-free rate of return

$StdDev Rx$ = Standard deviation of portfolio return (or, volatility)


### Calmar ratio (CR)
Calmar ratio refer to ratio of average annual rate to return to risk related to investments as it shows the relationship between return and risk and it is calculated by average annual rate of return divided by maximum drawdown for previous years.

$Calmar Ratio = \frac{Average Annual Rate of Return} {Maximum Drawdown}$

### Turnover
A turnover ratio represents the amount of assets or liabilities that a company replaces in relation to its sales. The concept is useful for determining the efficiency with which a business utilizes its assets. In most cases, a high asset turnover ratio is considered good, since it implies that receivables are collected quickly, fixed assets are heavily utilized, and little excess inventory is kept on hand.

$Turnover = \frac{Net credit sales} {Average account receivable}$

### Colog Ratio



### Mini Max Ratio
