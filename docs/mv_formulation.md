# Diversification techniques for portfolio optimization

The diversification techniques includes in the library are eleven. The complete list is:

### Equally weigthed approaches:
1. Equally weighted (EW) or 1/N portfolios.
2. Equally weighted risk contributions (EWRC).
3. Maximum diversification (MD).

### Controlling upper and lower bounds:
4. Weighted upper bound constraints (WUBC).
5. Weighted lower bound constraints (WLBC).

### Cost function approaches:
6. Diversified mean-variance strategy (DMV).
7. Diversified mean-variance strategy with yagger's entropy (DMVY).
8. Equally weighted minium variance (EWMV).

### Markowitz baseline formulation:
9. Global Maximum Return (GMR).
10. Global Minimum Variance (GMV).

PyInvestment is a library that implements mean-variance optimization methods. This library includes:

- 11 diversification and mean-variance strategies. [MV formulation.](https://github.com/faprieto96/pyInvestment)
- Data-driven method for determining the optimal value of the hyper-parameter associated with each eppoch. [Hyper-parameters description.](https://github.com/faprieto96/pyInvestment)
- 10 datasets focused on different markets. [Datasets description.](https://github.com/faprieto96/pyInvestment)
